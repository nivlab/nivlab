## Foundations

### Reinforcement learning & decision theory

#### [Niv (2008)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmp.2008.12.005)
{: .no_toc }
*Reinforcement learning in the brain*

> An introduction to the formal reinforcement learning framework, including a review of the multiple lines of evidence linking reinforcement learning to the function of dopaminergic neurons in the mammalian midbrain and to human imaging experiments.

#### [Dayan & Daw (2008)](https://doi.org/10.3758/CABN.8.4.429)
{: .no_toc }
*Decision theory, reinforcement learning, and the brain*

> A review of the Bayesian decision theoretic approach to decision making, showing how it unifies issues in Markovian decision problems, signal detection psychophysics, sequential sampling, and optimal exploration. Includes paradigmatic psychological and neural examples of each problem.

### General learning and memory

#### [Tolman (1948)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1949-00103-001)
{: .no_toc }
*Cognitive maps in rats and men*

> Classic and highly generative paper introducing the notion of cognitive maps

#### [McClelland, McNaughton, O'Reilly (1995)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1995-42327-001)
{: .no_toc }
*Why there are complementary learning systems in the hippocampus and neocortex: Insights from the successes and failures of connectionist models of learning and memory*

> Classic and highly influential computational modelling framework for complementary learning systems (cortex vs. hippocampus). A great use of neural network/distributed representations. The theory has been updated since, but it's a classic.

### Generalization, categorization & latent-cause inference

#### [Shepard (1987)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.3629243)
{: .no_toc }
*Toward a universal law of generalization for psychological science*

> The classic paper on generalization, deriving that the probability of generalization from one stimulus to another should decay approximately exponential with the psychological distance between the stimuli, which is confirmed by a range of empirical evidence.

#### [Anderson (1991)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1991-32228-001)
{: .no_toc }
*The adaptive nature of human categorization*

> The paper which introduced the non-parametric model of categorization on which our latent-cause inference models are based (using the Dirichlet process mixture/CRP prior).

#### [Gershman, Blei & Niv (2010)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2009-25263-004)
{: .no_toc }
*Context, learning, and extinction*

> A paper showing that learning about contexts in conditioning, just like categorization, is well-explained by latent-cause models. 

### Computational psychiatry

#### [Huys, Maia & Frank (2016)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4238)
{: .no_toc }
*Computational psychiatry as a bridge from neuroscience to clinical applications*

> An introduction to computational psychiatry, including a review of theory- and data-driven approaches and examples of each.

#### [Huys, Moutoussis & Williams(2011)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608011000852)
{: .no_toc }
*Are computational models of any use to psychiatry?*

> A paper discussing the benefits and challenges of using computational models in psychiatry in the form of a debate between two fictional characters.


## Experiments & Data Collection

### Online data quality

#### [Agley et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-021-01665-8)
{: .no_toc }
*Quality control questions on Amazonâ€™s Mechanical Turk (MTurk): A randomized trial of impact on the USAUDIT, PHQ-9, and GAD-7*

> An investigation of different attention checks in the online environment, and their resulting impacts in preventing skew in common psychiatric screening measures. Different quality control approaches significantly affect outcome scores on each of the screening tools.

#### [Zorowitz et al. (2021)](https://psyarxiv.com/rynhk)
{: .no_toc }
*Inattentive responding can induce spurious associations between task behavior and symptom measures*

> Demonstration of how spurious correlations can arise between task and self-report data in the presence of low-effort participants.

## Methods & Statistics
