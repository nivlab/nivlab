## Experiments & Data Collection

### Online data quality

#### [Agley et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-021-01665-8)
{: .no_toc }
*Quality control questions on Amazonâ€™s Mechanical Turk (MTurk): A randomized trial of impact on the USAUDIT, PHQ-9, and GAD-7*

> An investigation of different attention checks in the online environment, and their resulting impacts in preventing skew in common psychiatric screening measures. Different quality control approaches significantly affect outcome scores on each of the screening tools.

#### [Zorowitz et al. (2021)](https://psyarxiv.com/rynhk)
{: .no_toc }
*Inattentive responding can induce spurious associations between task behavior and symptom measures*

> Demonstration of how spurious correlations can arise between task and self-report data in the presence of low-effort participants.

## Methods & Statistics

### Mixed effects models

#### [Barr et al. (2013)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.jml.2012.11.001)
{: .no_toc }
*Random effects structure for confirmatory hypothesis testing: Keep it maximal*

> Recommendations for fitting to linear mixed-effects models to maximize generalizability across experiments.

#### [Meteyard & Davies (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jml.2020.104092)
{: .no_toc }
*Best practice guidance for linear mixed-effects models in psychological science*

> A set of best practice guidance, focusing on the reporting of linear mixed-effects models.

#### [Yu et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2021.10.030)
{: .no_toc }
*Beyond t test and ANOVA: applications of mixed-effects models for more rigorous statistical analysis in neuroscience research*

> A primer on linear and generalized mixed-effects models that consider data dependence and which provides clear instruction on how to recognize when they are needed and how to apply them.

### Cognitive modeling

#### [Wilson & Collins (2019)](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.49547)
{: .no_toc }
*Ten simple rules for the computational modeling of behavioral data*

> A beginner-friendly, pragmatic and details-oriented introduction on how to relate models to data. Covers model design, fitting, evaluation, and comparison.

### Stan programming language

#### [Betancourt (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02434)
{: .no_toc }
*A Conceptual Introduction to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo*

> A comprehensive conceptual account of the foundations of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, focusing on developing a principled intuition behind the method and its optimal implementations rather of any exhaustive rigor.

#### [Annis et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-016-0746-9)
{: .no_toc }
*Bayesian inference with Stan: A tutorial on adding custom distributions*

> A tutorial on how to use Stan and how to add custom distributions to it, with an example using the linear ballistic accumulator model.

#### [Baribault & Collins (2021)](https://psyarxiv.com/rtgew)
{: .no_toc }
*Troubleshooting Bayesian cognitive models: A tutorial with matstanlib*

> A deep treatment of the diagnostic checks and procedures that are critical for effective Stan troubleshooting, but are often left underspecified by tutorial papers.
