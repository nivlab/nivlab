# nivlab.github.io

The main hub for Niv lab's technical resource sites.

## Development

### Modifying the portfolio

For step-by-step instructions for adding to or modifying the project portfolio, see [Portfolio Theme](https://github.com/tedivm/jekyll-theme-portfolio#getting-started) README.

### Modifying the library

Edit the `library.md` file as you see fit :)

### Previewing the demos page locally

If you'd like to preview the site locally (for example, in the process of proposing a change):

1. Clone down the project's repository (`git clone https://github.com/nivlab/nivlab.github.io`)
2. `cd` into the project's directory
3. Run `bundle install` to install the necessary dependencies
4. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start the preview server
5. Visit `localhost:4000` in your browser to preview the project

This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to your theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.

When the theme is released, only the files in `_layouts`, `_includes`, and `_sass` tracked with Git will be released.
